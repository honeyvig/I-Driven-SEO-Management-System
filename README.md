    Automate Broken Link Detection.
    Integrate Automation via Zapier for Workflow Management.

Python Code Example for SEO Management System

1. Competitive Research & Analysis (Using OpenAI for Content Analysis):

This component will use OpenAI's GPT-3/4 to generate SEO recommendations based on competitor content analysis.

import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

# Function to analyze competitor content
def analyze_competitor_website(competitor_content):
    prompt = f"Analyze the following competitor content and suggest SEO improvements, new content ideas, and keyword opportunities. \n\nCompetitor Content:\n{competitor_content}\n\nSEO Suggestions:"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can replace it with GPT-4 if you have access
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=250,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
competitor_content = "This is a sample content from a competitor website discussing digital marketing strategies..."
seo_suggestions = analyze_competitor_website(competitor_content)
print("SEO Suggestions:", seo_suggestions)

2. Broken Link Identification & Outreach (Web Scraping for Broken Links):

We can use Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to identify broken links.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Function to check if a URL is broken (404 or not found)
def is_broken_link(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 404:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return False

# Scraping example
def scrape_and_find_broken_links(website_url):
    response = requests.get(website_url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    links = soup.find_all('a', href=True)
    broken_links = []

    for link in links:
        url = link['href']
        if is_broken_link(url):
            broken_links.append(url)

    return broken_links

# Example usage
website_url = "https://example.com"
broken_links = scrape_and_find_broken_links(website_url)
print("Broken Links Found:", broken_links)

3. SEO-Focused Content Creation (Generating SEO Content with OpenAI):

This code uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 to generate SEO-optimized content, including keyword inclusion and readability.

def generate_seo_content(topic, keywords):
    prompt = f"Generate a well-structured, SEO-optimized blog post about {topic}. Include the keywords {', '.join(keywords)} naturally in the content. Make sure the content is engaging, well-written, and follows best SEO practices."

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use GPT-4 here if needed
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
topic = "The Future of Digital Marketing"
keywords = ["SEO", "content marketing", "digital strategy", "online branding"]
seo_content = generate_seo_content(topic, keywords)
print("Generated SEO Content:", seo_content)

4. Automating Workflows with Zapier (or Similar Platforms):

You can automate workflows in Zapier or Make (Integromat) by connecting Python scripts with various platforms.

    For example, in Zapier, you can use Webhooks to trigger Python functions and then send the results to Google Sheets, email, or other platforms.
    In Make (Integromat), you can connect multiple apps to automate processes between OpenAI, broken link detection, and content management tools.

Here’s an example of integrating Python with Zapier (via Webhooks):

Python Script (To Be Triggered by Zapier Webhook):

import json
import openai

def handle_zapier_webhook(data):
    # Get the data from the webhook request
    competitor_content = data['competitor_content']
    
    # Perform SEO analysis
    seo_suggestions = analyze_competitor_website(competitor_content)
    
    # Return results to Zapier (or any other platform)
    return json.dumps({"seo_suggestions": seo_suggestions})

# Example usage - Trigger the function when a webhook request is received
# You can replace this with your own webhook handler logic
webhook_data = {"competitor_content": "Sample competitor website content to analyze"}
result = handle_zapier_webhook(webhook_data)
print(result)

    In Zapier, create a new Zap that triggers when a new task is received via Webhook, and then connect it to your Python code (via a webhook URL), which returns the SEO suggestions.
